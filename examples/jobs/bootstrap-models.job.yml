task: |
  Your task is to update the provider files in ./src/ai/<provider>/models.ts

  I have a script that is in ./scripts/getModels.ts. You can run it using `npx ./scripts/getModels.ts`.
  This file contains a script that runs against all the different APIs in this repository
  (OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic). If you run the script, it will return all models available in the API.

  Now I need you to filter the models to only include modern, recommended models.

  Filter criteria:
  - Skip deprecated models (anything with "deprecated" in the name)
  - Skip fine-tuned models (ft:*, *-ft-*, etc.)
  - Skip embedding models (text-embedding-*, embed-*)
  - Skip audio/speech models (whisper-*, tts-*)
  - Skip image generation models (dall-e-*)
  - Keep flagship chat/completion models
  - For versioned models, prefer the latest stable version

  For each provider, output TypeScript code with:
  1. A `Models` const object mapping CONSTANT_NAMES to model IDs
  2. Inside the Models const, have aliases for latest model family names, i.e., CLAUDE_SONNET_4_5_LATEST mirrors to the latest CLAUDE_SONNET_4_5 if model names are date specific.
  3. Prefer the cheap models (Haiku, OpenAI 5 mini, Gemini Flash equivalent) as the default model
  4. You must not rename exported constants because other files refer to them.

  Format the output as a single TypeScript file that can be used to replace
  the existing model definitions.
